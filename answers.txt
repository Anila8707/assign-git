• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
• Why should you have different branches?
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

1) .gitignore file will be at the root folder of the repo and we have add the extensions of the file those we want to exclude form the repo. We have to include *.jar, *.class files.
2) Merging the changes of another branch to your local branch without any conflcits is a fast forward.
3) avoiding frequent conflicts between members, the indiviuals should be responsible for his/her changes and to frequently sync with master of the development branch
4) no limit and based on requirement can make more than 1 repo
